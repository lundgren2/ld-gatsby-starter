# lundgren.tech

This is my personal website.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    1. Setup .env variable and then:

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

    Open the `lundgren.tech` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
